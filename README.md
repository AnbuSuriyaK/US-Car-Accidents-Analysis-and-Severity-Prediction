# 🚗 US Car Accidents: Analysis & Severity Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing U.S. car accident data to uncover key patterns and build predictive models that estimate accident severity. The ultimate goal is to support data-driven decisions for road safety and policy improvements.

## 📊 Project Overview

The workflow includes:

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature Engineering  
- Predictive Modeling with Hyperparameter Tuning  
- A/B Testing for Comparative Analysis  
- Dashboard Design for Visual Insights  

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains detailed records of U.S. car accidents, including:

- Location (state, city, GPS coordinates)  
- Weather and road conditions  
- Time and date of occurrence  
- Severity levels (target variable)

> Dataset Source: [US Accidents (Kaggle)]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents](https://www.kaggle.com/code/muhammadfurqan0/us-data-analysis-beginner-notebook#Download-the-Data))

## 🔍 EDA Highlights

- Identified high-incident areas by state and city  
- Correlated severity with weather, visibility, and time of day  
- Visualized trends using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**  
- Conducted A/B testing to assess feature impacts on model performance  

## 🧠 ML Models Used

- **Decision Tree Regressor**  
- **Random Forest Regressor**  
- **Gradient Boosting**  
- **XGBoost**

All models were tuned using **GridSearchCV** and **cross-validation** to improve performance.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **A/B Testing Framework**

## 📈 Results

- Achieved strong predictive performance with **XGBoost**  
- Revealed key severity drivers: poor visibility, weather, time of day, and urban areas  
- Designed a data-driven dashboard for risk assessment and pattern recognition

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Build **real-time alert systems** for high-risk zones  
- Incorporate more granular weather and traffic data
